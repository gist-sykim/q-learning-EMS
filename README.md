# Q-learning-based EMS algorithm
This is the source code of the MATLAB simulations.  
The algorithm reduces the building energy costs by applying Q-learning.

## File list
README.md - This file  
main.m - Main code for EMS  
qlearnig.m - MATLAB function for Q-learning algorithm  

## Data required
In 'main.m', data sets of builidng demand, PV generation, and V2G demand should be input.  
(See lines 47-49) 

## Version update
Source codes will be continuously updated.
